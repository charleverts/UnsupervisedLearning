# UnsupervisedLearning

This repo contains my code and final submissions for the 2 Assignments completed as part of the UnSupervised Learning module in the MPhil Fintech program.

### Assignment 1: 
Conduct Partitional and Hierarchical Clustering to determine whether regional COVID-19 patterns exist using the Our World in Data: COVID-19 dataset.

### Assignment 2: 
Build 2 K-Nearest Neighbour models:
* classify the number 5 or 8 from the 20,000 entry MNIST dataset.
* predict wether a patient's tumor is malignant or benign using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset.
Once built, evaluate predictive accuracy of results. Then conduct dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analaysis, Multi-Dimensional Scaling and the ISOmaps.
